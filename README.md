Implemetation of  

The objective of the project is to implement a bipartitioning tool in C language for combinational circuits. Fiduccia-Mattheyses-Algorithm is implemented for partitioning ISCASâ€™85 benchmark combinational circuit. Two main parameters are observed Number of passes and cutset. Additionaly, timing for each benchmark is also measured.
